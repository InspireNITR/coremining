            <u>CAUSES OF OZONE LAYER DEPLETION AND ITS EFFECTS</u>
        </h1>

        <br>


        <h3 style="color:orange;">INTRODUCTION:-</h3>

        <p>Many of human activities are badly affecting the atmosphere. Ozone depletion is one
            of those examples. Life is protected from UV rays by stratospheric ozone layer which
            acts as a shield or sun screen. Approximately 90% ozone is present in stratosphere at
            the height of 10 to 17 kilometer and is called ozone layer while remaining 10% is present
            in troposphere. Medium frequency UV radiations (200 nm to 315 nm) are absorbed 97
            to 99% by the ozone layer. Ozone (O3) is colourless just like oxygen (O2) but it has very
            harsh odour. It is very rare as compared to oxygen. It is estimated that out of 10 million
            air molecules about 2 millions are of O2 andonly 3 are of ozone. The process of ozone
            formation is called as photolysis. When the UV radiations from sun strike the O2
            molecules, it causes splitting of O2. Oxygen molecules react with oxygen atoms in the
            upper atmosphere to form ozone. Stratospheric ozone is measured from the ground in
            units called “Dobson Unit” (D.U). Normal ozone concentration is between 300 - 350 D.U.
            In our present study, we shall discuss how ozone layer depletion is affecting human
            health and we shall also discuss some recommendations to minimize ozone depletion
            and its adverse effects on human health.</p>


        <h3 style="color:orange;">Ozone Layer :-</h3>

        <p>The ozone layer is basically naturally occurring gas in the region of stratosphere where
            ozone particles are accumulated. Ozone layer is also naturally broken down but there is
            a balance between its formation and natural depletion. As a result the total amount of
            ozone remains constant. But ozone layer thickness varies with altitude and seasonal
            change. Ozone concentration is highest between 19 - 23 km. Most of ozone is formed
            at equator where there is maximum sunshine but with winds it travels at high altitude
            and get accumulated in stratosphere
        </p>

        </div>


        <h3 style="color:orange;">Ozone Hole</h3>

        <p>Ozone hole is created in the region where ozone layer has been depleted. The term
            “Ozone hole” is applied when the depletion level is below 200 Dobson Unit (D.U). Ozone
            holes are first discovered in Antarctica in 1970. Few years ago ozone holes are also
            discovered in arctic region. Since 2000 rate of ozone depletion is increasing 0.5 percent
            per year. Due to depletion of Ozone UV rays are penetrating in troposphere and leading
            to more ozone formation in troposphere which is causing injurious effects on our health
            as ozone is toxic for our body.</p>

        <h3>Causes of Ozone Depletion:-</h3>


        <h4 style="color:orange;">(A) Chlorofluorocarbons:-</h4>

        <p>Ozone depletion occurs when the natural balance between the production and
            destruction of stratospheric ozone is disturbed. Although natural phenomenon can
            cause ozone depletion but human activities such as CFCs are now accepted as major
            cause of depletion. All ozone depleting chemicals contain chlorine and bromine. CFCs
            are highly volatile and non combustible so they are very quickly evaporated and can
            easily reach in stratosphere where ozone is present here they start depleting ozone
            molecules. These CFCs have also adverse affects on human health. According to the
            chemical model for ozone destruction proposed about 20 years ago, the photolysis of
            Cl2O2 is key to ozone depletion reaction. But now atmospheric researchers studied that
            the rate of this reaction is not extremely high as it was thought previously so we can no
            longer say that CFCs are the main cause of ozone depletion.</p>

            <img src="articles-img/7.3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
        </div>

        <h4 style="color:orange;">(B) Unregulated Launches of Rockets:-</h4>

        <p>Another major cause of large scale ozone depletion is Rocket launches. It has been
            studied that unregulated rocket launches can result in much more ozone depletion than
            CFCs. It is estimated that if rocket launches will be let unregulated then it would cause
            huge ozone loss by the year 2050 than the CFCs have done.</p>

            <img src="articles-img/7.4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
        </div>

        <h4 style="color:orange;">(C) Global Warming:-</h4>

        <p>Global warming also leads to ozone layer depletion. Due to global warming and green house
            effect most of the heat is trapped in troposphere which is the layer below the stratosphere. As
            we all know ozone is present in stratosphere so heat don’t reaches troposphere and it remain
            cold as recovery of ozone layer requires maximum sunlight and heat so it leads to depletion of
            ozone layer.
        </p>

            <img src="articles-img/7.5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
        </div>


        <h4 style="color:orange;">(D)Nitrogenous Compound:-</h4>


        <p>Nitrogenous Compounds emitted by human activities in small amount like NO, N2O and NO2
            are considered to be greatly responsible for the ozone layer.</p>


        <h3 style="color:orange;">Effects of Ozone Depletion:-</h3>

        <p>Ozone depletion is affecting the human health and environment negatively, as it allows the
            penetration of UV radiations to reach the Earth. These radiations can cause severe diseases in
            humans such as skin cancer, eye damage and genetic mutations etc. Furthermore the ozone
            depletion is affecting the aquatic life, biogeochemical cycles, air quality and also contributing
            in Global warming but in this review paper our main focus is on the effects of ozone depletion
            on human health.</p>


        <h4 style="color:orange;">(A) Effects on Eyes:-</h4>

        <p>The major cause of blindness in this world is cataracts. There would be 0.3% - 0.6% increase in
            risk of cataract if there will be 1% decrease in Ozone level . Eye lens can be damaged by
            oxidative agents. Oxidative oxygen produced by UV radiation can severely damage eye lens
            and cornea of eye is also badly damaged by UV radiation. Photokeratitis, cataract, blindness all
            are caused due to UV rays.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8  p-4 mx-auto my-3">
            <img src="articles-img/7.6.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
        </div>


        <h4 style="color:orange;">(B) Effects on Skin:-</h4>

        <p>Exposure to UV radiations can cause skin cancer. UV radiations alter the structure of
            biomolecules and thus lead to different diseases Skin is the most often exposed part of body
            to UV radiations There are two types of skin cancer, Melanoma and Non-melanoma.
            Melanoma is most serious form of cancer and is often fatal, while non-melanoma is most
            common type and less fatal. Depletion of ozone layer leads to both Sun burn and skin cancer.
            UV radiations are also responsible for breast cancer and leukemia . Epidemiological studies of</p>


        <div class="col-md-8  p-4 mx-auto my-3">
            <img src="articles-img/7.7.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
        </div>


        <p>melanoma indicate that the incidence of melanoma is increasing in those countries having
            high ratio of cases. As UV radiations can penetrate more easily in thin skin so there is greater
            number of incidence is found in thin skinned people. It is found that the incidence of
            Melanoma is more in children than adults. The chance of incidence of melanoma is correlated
            with UV exposure furthermore the survival chance of melanoma is less in boys as compared to
            girls . As the intensity of radiation increases in summer so the risk of melanoma in thin skinned
            people is increased in summer and it is more in females as compared to males as their skin is
            thinner than males . There is considerable relationship between melanoma risk and
            intermittent sun exposure and sunburn history. There is also a direct relationship between air
            travelling and melanoma incidence . However the studies revealed that genetic factors
            contribute more for having melanoma disease than behavioral aspects. The epidemiological
            studies of non melanoma skin carcinoma (NMSC) indicates that its risk is more in young
            females in lower limbs and sunbathing increases its risk five times in trunk region.</p>

        <h4 style="color:orange;">(C) Effects on Human Immunity:-</h4>

        <p>Exposure to UV radiations can also result in suppression of immune response to skin cancer,
            infectious diseases and other antigens. The immunosupression is due to changes in skin
            photoreceptors and antigen presenting cells that are brought by UV radiations. More increase
            in depletion of ozone results in more decrease in immune system.
        </p>




        <h4 style="color:orange;">(D) DNA Damage and Lung Diseases:-</h4>



        <p>Short exposure to UV-B radiations can cause the DNA damage because UV radiations can
            disturb biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and Nucliec acids. Due to UV-B radiations there
            would be cryptic transposable elements which may lead towards the mutations which is more
            dangerous than the immediate DNA damage. Excessive UV-B radiation exposure results in the
            basal and squamous cells carcinomas. These types of cancers are induced due to
            transcriptional errors during DNA replication which are caused by changes in pyrimidine bases.
            The ultimate cause of this whole mechanism is found to be the prolonged exposure to UV
            radiations. It is estimated that there is increase of 2% of incidence of these cancers by 1%
            depletion of ozone layer. Exposure to UV radiations equally affects lungs. Bronchitis,
            obstruction of lungs, Emphysema, asthma all can be resulted from UV radiations exposure.</p>


        <h4 style="color:orange;">(E) Effects of Hydrogen Peroxide on Human Health:-</h4>

        <p>Due to stratospheric ozone layer depletion UV radiations are penetrating in earth atmosphere
            which result in the production of reduced oxygen. Highly reactive species like hydrogen
            peroxide is produced which has bad effects on human health. It is ideal photochemical maker
            due to its long life and stability . Hydrogen peroxide is toxicant and it pollutes drinking water
            especially in lakes and makes water toxic and unfit for drinking. IT alters redox chemistry of
            metals that are used by our body like iron copper and manganese.</p>





        <h4 style="color:orange;">(F) Effect of Food Shortage on Human Population:-</h4>

        <p>Depletion of ozone layer is also causing the problem of food shortage to humans. UV
            radiations are disturbing developmental and physiological processes which is decreasing the
            productivity of crops. As humans are heavily dependent on crops for food so there is a great
            chance if depletion of ozone layer is not checked it may cause seriously shortage of food to
            humans. Researches also show that UV radiations can also be used to enhance yield of crops
            by the use and application of phytohormones.</p>


        <h3 style="color:orange;">5. Conclusion and Recommendations:-</h3>

        <p>Ozone layer is continuously depleting which is highly alarming situation of today.
            Chloroflourocarbons are major cause of ozone depletion. These substances should be banned
            or we should use their alternatives so that in future we can protect ourselves from the
            harmful effects of UV radiation. Human eye and skin are the most exposed part of the body to
            these radiations. So there is high degree of incidence of blindness and skin cancer disease
            increasing day by day with the depletion of ozone layer so we should use sunglasses and full
            body clothes especially in summer when there is high intensity of sunlight so that we can
            protect our body from harmful UV radiations. We should also use sun block creams to our
            most exposed parts of body like face. We should also don’t consume water from lakes as it
            may contain high quantity of hydrogen peroxide which is toxic to our bodies, and we should
            consume water for drinking from clean water sources.</p>
