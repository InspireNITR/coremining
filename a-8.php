            <u> Preparative Main Group and Transition Metal Chemistry</u>
        </h1>

        <br>


        <p>In chemistry and atomic physics, the main group is the group of elements(sometimes called
            the representative elements) whose lightest members are represented by helium, lithium,
            beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine as arranged in the periodic table of
            the elements. The main group includes the elements in groups 1and 2 groups 13 to 18(p
            block). The s-block elements are primarily characterized by one main oxidation states
            separated by 2 units. Main group elements are the most abundant elements on earth, in the
            solar system and in the universe.</p>


        <p>Transition metals are defined as those elements that have partially filled d orbitals. The dblock
            elements in groups 3-11 are transition elements. The f-block elements, also called inner
            transition metals (the lanthanides and actinides), also meet this criterion because the dorbital
            is partially occupied before the f orbitals. The d orbitals fill with the copper family
            (group 11); for this reason, the next family (group 12) are technically not transition elements.
            However, the group 12 elements do display some of the same chemical properties and are
            commonly included in discussions of transition metals. Some chemist do treat the group 12
            elements as transition metals.</p>

        <p>
            The d-block elements are divided into the 1st transition series(the elements Sc through Cu),
            the 2nd transition series(the elements Y through Ag) and the 3rd transition series(the elements
            La and the elements Hf through Au). Actinium(Ac) is the first member of 4th transition series,
            which also includes Rf through Rg.


        </p>

        <p>The f-block elements are the elements are the elements Ce through Lu, which contribute the
            lanthanide series(or lanthanoid series) and the elements Th through Lr, which constitute the
            actinide series(or actinoid series). Because lanthanum behaves very much like the lanthanide
            elements, it is considered a lanthanide element, even through its e- configuration makes it
            the first member of the 3rd transition series. Similarly, the behavior series, although its
            electron configuration makes it the first member of the fourth transition series.</p>


        <p>Both the d- and f-block elements react with nonmetals to form binary compounds; heating is
            often required. These elements react with halogens to form a variety of halides ranging in
            oxidation state form 1+ to 6+. On heating, oxygen reacts with all of the transition elements
            except palladium, platinum, silver, and gold. The oxides of these latter metals can be formed
            using other reactants, but they decompose upon heating. The f-block elements, the elements
            of group 3, and the elements of the first transition of acids, forming hydrogen gas and
            solutions of the corresponding salts.</p>

        </div>


        <p>Transition metals can form compounds with a wide range of oxidation states. As we move
            from left to right across the first transition series, we see that no of common oxidation states
            increases at first to maximum towards the middle of the table, the decrease. The values in
            the table are typical values; these are other known values; and it is possible to synthesize new
            additions. For example, in 2014 researchers were successful in synthesizing a new oxidation
            state of iridium(9+).</p>


        <p>The bonding in the simple compounds of the transition metals ranges from ionic to covalent.
            In their lower oxidation states, the transition metals from ionic compounds; in their higher
            oxidation states, they form covalent compounds or polyatomic ions. The variation in
            oxidation- reduction chemistry. The chemistry of several classes of compounds containing
            metals of transition series as halides, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and other salts.</p>
